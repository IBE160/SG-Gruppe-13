## Sprint Plan: Sentiabot

This document outlines the sprint plan for the implementation of the Sentiabot project. The implementation phase is scheduled for two weeks.

### Sprint 1 (Week 4)

**Goal:** Implement the core functionality of the chatbot, including the end-to-end chat flow and the integration with the knowledge base.

**Epics:**

*   **Epic 1: Foundational End-to-End Chat**
    *   Story 1.1: As a student, I want to access a deployed application and see a "Hello World" message from the backend, so that I know the core system is operational.
    *   Story 1.2: As a student, I want to see a single page with an input field and receive a hardcoded response, so that I can see the most basic chat functionality working.
    *   Story 1.3: As a student, I want my question to be sent to an AI model and get a real, generated response, so that I can have a true conversational experience.
*   **Epic 2: Knowledge-Driven, Contextual Chat**
    *   Story 2.1: As a student, I want the chatbot to use a dedicated knowledge base for its answers, so that I receive trustworthy information instead of made-up answers.
    *   Story 2.2: As a student, I want to choose a subject category before chatting, so that the answers I get are more relevant to what I'm studying.
    *   Story 2.3: As a student, I want to select my grade level, so the chatbot can use language that is easy for me to understand.

### Sprint 2 (Week 5)

**Goal:** Enhance the user experience and implement the administration features.

**Epics:**

*   **Epic 3: Enhanced User Experience and Features**
    *   Story 3.1: As a student, I want to interact with a simple, colorful, and easy-to-navigate interface, so that I can focus on learning without getting distracted.
    *   Story 3.2: As a student, I want the chatbot to provide the source for its information, so that I can check where the answer came from.
    *   Story 3.3: As a student, I want to be able to ask questions and get answers in both Norwegian and English, so that I can use the language I'm most comfortable with.
    *   Story 3.4: As a student, I want to download my chat history, so that I can save it and look at it later.
*   **Epic 4: Administration and System Management**
    *   Story 4.1: As an administrator, I need a secure way to log in, so that only authorized users can manage the system.
    *   Story 4.2: As an administrator, I want an interface to add, edit, and delete content in the knowledge base, so that I can keep the information accurate and up-to-date.
    *   Story 4.3: As an administrator, I want to be able to modify the chatbot's system prompt, so that I can refine its behavior and tone without needing to redeploy the application.
