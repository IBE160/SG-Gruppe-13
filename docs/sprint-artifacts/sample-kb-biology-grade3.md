# What is Photosynthesis?

Photosynthesis is how plants make their own food! Plants use sunlight, water, and a gas called carbon dioxide to create sugar (food) and oxygen. This amazing process happens in the leaves of plants, in tiny parts called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have a special green stuff called chlorophyll, which helps them catch the sunlight.

**Here's a simple way to think about it:**
- **Sunlight:** Gives energy to the plant.
- **Water:** Absorbed by the roots from the soil.
- **Carbon Dioxide:** A gas from the air that plants breathe in.
- **Sugar (Food):** The energy plants use to grow.
- **Oxygen:** A gas that plants release into the air, which we breathe!

So, plants are like little food factories that use sunshine to grow and help us breathe!
